# BlackJack
This is a game of BlackJack
The Deck File is responsible for making the deck of cards
The GamePlay file is responsible for checking the numerical value of cards, checking for bust, checking if the dealer should hit, 
and checking if the dealer or player has any aces and adjusting for that since those can be valued at either 1 or 11
The PlayBlackJack file is reponsible for dealing cards to the player and dealer, asking the player if they want to hit or stand, displaying results,
and asking the player if they want to play again
